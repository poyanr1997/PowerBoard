# PowerBoard

This is a low-cost, non-isolated power board designed for circuits that require no more than 160mA of current. The board operates at a default output of 12V, but you can easily adjust the voltage by swapping out the Zener diode, making it versatile for different applications.

Features:

Non-Isolated: Ideal for circuits that don't require electrical isolation.

Output Voltage: 12V (adjustable by replacing the Zener diode).

Maximum Current: Can power circuits up to 160mA.

Affordable: A cost-effective solution for small, low-power projects.

Usage Notes:

This board is great for powering low-power devices or circuits that donâ€™t need isolation.

Make sure the current draw of your circuit does not exceed 160mA to avoid damage.this a not isolated cheap powerboard use for any circurt that dont need more than 160mA.
it is 12v but you can change the voltage by changing the Zener Diode.
